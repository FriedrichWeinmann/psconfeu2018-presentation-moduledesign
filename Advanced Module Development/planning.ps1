Presentation notes:
Fred in control of notebook / code
Chrissy engaging the audience

Main Game Card: Double Team tactics:
- Chrissy tells of a crisis/issue we had to address (whether the original was realization first or not)
- Fred tells the audience about a feature and the technical niceties (bad cop)
- Chrissy takes over and tells of the practical benefits & impact to the team and module (good cop)

Sub Game Card: The Question Game
- "1" presents something that is clearly suboptimal
- "2" questions it
- "1" thinks about and offers a solution (that is better but not good enough)
- "2" asks more deeply about it
- "1" either finds the solution or in frustration asks "2" for a solution when s/he's seeing all the issues
